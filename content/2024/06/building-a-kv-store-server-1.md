# Building a Kv Store server (Part-1)

## Motivation

 I've started reading the Amazon DynamoDb paper, and I thought it will be a great idea to try implementing the paper. 

## Scope for this part 
- Build a memory based key-value store
- Create 1 endpoint for inserting an new key-value pair
- Another endpoint to fetch the value for a key
